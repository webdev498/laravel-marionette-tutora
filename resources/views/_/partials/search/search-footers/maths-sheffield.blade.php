<p>All our tutors have passed our rigorous interview, with only one in four of the tutors who apply to us make it through. Our tutors are selected for their teaching knowledge and experience, as well as their friendly nature	and skill in passing on their knowledge to others. We also have a large number of tutors who can help with Maths-related disciplines such as Statistics, Mechanics, and Further Maths. To search for these,	simply type the specific subject you are looking for, and enter the information into the search box at the top of the page.	Lessons typically take place in your home, though some tutors only provide tuition in their own home. The best way to find out is to get in touch with the tutor directly through the website, and let them know what you are looking for. They will get back to you quickly and let you know if they can help. When you are ready to go ahead with your Maths lesson, the tutor will book it in for you and you will be asked to confirm the lesson by entering your payment details. We hope you enjoy your maths lesson!</p>
